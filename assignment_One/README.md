#This assignment was focused on handling real world data of global development patterns, having to preprocess 
 it in order to perform clustering applications.
•We were also tasked with evaluating and optimizing  clustering algorithms through 
 various initialization and convergence strategies.
• Assess cluster quality using multiple validation approaches
• Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to improve clustering performance
• Critically analyze the trade-offs in clustering design decisions

TOOLS:
python
numpy
pandas
tSNE
